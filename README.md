<h2 align="center">Self-Hosting & Development</h2>

**We ask you to please not host your own instance of Hydra.** Even though our license allows it, self-hosted instances of the bot have brought us a lot of headache in the past. If you're considering self-hosting, please [try the official instance of the bot first](https://github.com/DarkThunder099/Hydra/#). If you have any concerns about the security of our instance, please contact us. We'd love to talk and answer any questions you have.

If you're really really really going to self-host the bot, please [read our license](https://github.com/DarkThunder099/Hydra/blob/master/LICENSE) first, and be aware that we don't provide any self-hosting support. **You'll be on your own.**
